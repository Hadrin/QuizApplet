# QuizApplet

Quiz Applet is designed as a proof of concept for a web based quiz system.
Additional questions can be easily programmed in using the existing questions located in script.js as a template
Once the new question object is created, add it to the Q array and the software will handle the rest.

Each correct answer will increase the user's score by one point

Each incorrect answer will decrease the user's remaining time by five seconds

At the end of the timer, the user will have the option to submit their score as well as their initials to be stored
The last stored score will be displayed on the landing screen
